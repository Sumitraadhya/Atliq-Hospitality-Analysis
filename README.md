# Atliq Hospitality Analysis

## Problem Statement

Atliq Grands owns multiple five-star hotels across India. They have been in the hospitality industry for the past 20 years. Due to strategic moves from other competitors and ineffective decision-making in management, Atliq Grands are losing its market share and revenue in the luxury/business hotels category. As a strategic move, the managing director of Atliq Grands wanted to incorporate “Business and Data Intelligence” in order to regain their market share and revenue. However, they do not have an in-house data analytics team to provide them with these insights.

Their revenue management team had decided to hire a 3rd party service provider to provide them with insights from their historical data.

## Project Outcome

-ADR is not fluctuating that clearly indicates this hotel runs on flat pricing.

-RevPar in weekday, weekend varying based on occupancy %, ADR is almost fixed here. That clearly indicates dynamic pricing (price can be variable depends on season, occasion and demand) adoption strategy especially for leisure hotels can be accounted.

-Management can adopt changes for dynamic pricing strategy which can bring furthermore business in the future.

-If Pareto principle can be followed, overcoming the business challenges will be easier. If they can focus more on the least performing hotels(such as improving feedback/ratings, focus on feedback received from customers,  location area type, room category, amenities provided) and try to improve the  level 3 and level 4 problematic areas, would be easier to generate more revenue.

-Mumbai generates the highest revenue (669 M) followed by Bangalore, Hyderabad and Delhi.

-Presedentials rooms bring the highest revenue.

-Atliq Seasons (Mumbai) is the lowest-rated hotel.

-AtliQ Palace delhi has the highest occupancy of 66%
